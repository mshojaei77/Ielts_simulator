            <h2>The Development of Plastic</h2>
            
            <div class="reading-passage">
                <p><strong>A</strong> The first synthetic plastic was invented in 1907 by Leo Baekeland, a Belgian-born American chemist. He was attempting to find a replacement for shellac, a natural plastic derived from the resin secreted by the lac bug. Baekeland's invention, which he named Bakelite, was the first plastic made entirely from synthetic components.</p>

                <p><strong>B</strong> The development of plastic has revolutionized manufacturing and daily life. From packaging materials to medical devices, plastic has become an integral part of modern society. However, this convenience comes with environmental costs that are becoming increasingly apparent.</p>

                <p><strong>C</strong> Early plastics were developed to replace natural materials that were becoming scarce or expensive. Ivory, for example, was widely used for billiard balls, but as elephant populations declined, manufacturers sought alternatives. Celluloid, one of the first thermoplastics, provided a solution.</p>

                <p><strong>D</strong> The mass production of plastic began during World War II, when natural resources were diverted to the war effort. Plastic became a substitute for materials like metal, glass, and wood. This period saw rapid innovation in plastic technology and manufacturing processes.</p>

                <p><strong>E</strong> Today, plastic production has reached unprecedented levels. However, the environmental impact of plastic waste has become a global concern. Scientists and manufacturers are now focusing on developing biodegradable plastics and improving recycling technologies.</p>
